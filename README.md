# Gitmoji by SK027

[Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) is a project dedicated to standardising and explaining the use of emoticons in GitHub commit messages.

- As there are so many different emot-icons, here is list of some, which I choose to use as my git commit message. The project is not commercial, but rather my personal preference for includingÂ emojisÂ in commit messages. This project is open source so, anyone can contribute by suggesting or adding new emojis.

## Setup

Download Node.js. Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Run the local server at locat ip
npm run host

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
